THE USERS INDICATED THAT THE INFUSION PRESSURE WAS VERY LOW DURING BOTH THE PHACO AND VITRECTOMY MODES, WHICH WERE ALSO CONFIRMED AT THE LOG FILE REVIEW OF THE EVA. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE LOG FILE REVIEW REVEALED WITH NO SETTING ERRORS HAD BEEN PERFORMED BY THE USER NOR OBVIOUS SOFTWARE FAILURES.

ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS: ASSESSMENT REGARDING THE DEVICE INVOLVED IN THE FIELD. DORC HAD REPLACED THE PUMP, THE EVA AT FIELD WORKS WELL WITH NO MORE SIMILAR COMPLAINTS AFTER THEN. FROM THE EVA MEMORY LOGFILE REVIEW, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE EVA WAS WORKING AS DESIGNED. THE INCORRECT INFUSION ASPIRATION PRESSURE WERE RECORDED. HOWEVER, NO SOFTWARE NOR SETTING ERRORS WERE DETECTED BY THE EVA MAIN DEVICE. FROM THE RETURNED PUMP (EVA COMPONENT) INSPECTION, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE PUMP IS IN A GOOD CONDITION AND COULD NOT HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEM AS FAR AS ALL TESTS WERE PASSED AND WITH NO DEVIATIONS WERE FOUND. INVESTIGATION ON POTENTIAL MECHANICAL OBSTRUCTION, FROM THE INSPECTION ON THE RETURNED VGPC PACK (8310.25G02), WITH A CARTRIDGE, TUBINGS AND A VITRECTOME CUTTER INCLUDED, TO CHECK WHETHER EXISTENCE OF MECHANICAL OBSTRUCTION; WE CONCLUDE THAT ALL RETURNED SUBJECT ACCESSORIES WHICH WERE USED ARE WORKING WITH NO ABNORMALITIES. OTHERS-TO IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL OTHER ROOT CAUSES, WE HAVE ALSO CONSIDERED POSSIBLE DEFECTS OF THAT, INFUSION CLAMP AND INFUSION TUBING WAS PROPERLY NOT WELL CONNECTED, SUCH AS BLOCKAGE, FOLDED OR TWISTED OF VGPC AND IRRIGATION INFUSION LINES OR THE CLAMP WAS NOT OPEN, FORGOT TO TURN THE STOPCOCK HANDLE TO 90 DEGREES ANTI-CLOCKWISE AS DESCRIBED IN THE MANUAL. (ONLY APPLICABLE TO VGPC VITRECTOMY PROCEDURE, PHACO MODE IS NOT NEEDED.) THE CAP OF AIR FILTER OF THE DRIP CHAMBER (GRAVITY INFUSION) WAS ACCIDENTALLY CLOSED. THE VGPC AIR FILTER IS NOT WELL CONNECTED. THE CANNULA COULD BE BLOCKED (ONLY IN VITRECTOMY STEP), HOWEVER, THE SAMPLE WAS NOT SENT BACK FOR INVESTIGATION. COMMENT-SINCE BOTH PHACO AND VITRECTOMY PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS BOTH VGPC AND GRAVITY INFUSIONS EXPERIENCED LOW IRRIGATION PRESSURES, SO THESE CANNOT HAD HAPPENED AT ALL THESE SITUATIONS IF THERE WAS ONLY ONE ROOT CAUSE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEFECT. HOWEVER, SINCE THERE WAS NO VIDEO NOR PHOTOGRAPHS HAD BEEN TAKEN FOR REVIEW THE PROCESS OF THE EVENT, NEITHER FROM THE USERS, ABOVE ASSUMPTIONS CANNOT BE CONFIRMED. SINCE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE INDICATES SOFTWARE OR PUMP PROBLEMS, IT IS MOST LIKELY THE DEFECT OF LOW AIR PRESSURE WAS CAUSED BY A MECHANICAL OBSTRUCTION.

THIS PATIENT WAS RE-SCHEDULED WITH ANOTHER OPERATION THE NEXT WEEK WHERE A SULCUS IOL WAS IMPLANTED WITH NO FURTHER ISSUES. THE EVA UNIT IS AT THE HOSPITAL. THE USED INTERFACE PLATE WAS RETURNED TO DORC FOR INVESTIGATION. DORC CONSIDERS THAT CAPSULAR RUPTURE IS AN UNINTENTIONAL PERFORATION OF THE CAPSULAR BAG.

THE INTERFACE PLATE WHICH CAUSED THE PUMP MODULE TO GO IN OFFLINE MODUS. DORC CONSIDERED THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THE REPORTED INCIDENT WAS BECAUSE OF THE COMBINATION OF BOTH FAILURES RESULTED IN NOT COMPLETING THE OPERATION. PHACO PERFORMANCE-THE ANALYSIS OF THE PHACO PERFORMANCE SHOWS THAT THE SURGEON SETTINGS IN COMBINATION WITH A 2.8MM PHACO TIP CREATES A SURGE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE CAPSULAR RUPTURE. DURING THE DEMO PHASE OF EVA 903 SURGEON SETTINGS (300 MMHG VACUUM WITH A NORMAL INCREASE) WERE PROGRAMMED BY DORC, WHICH THE SURGEON AGREED WITH. FOR UNCLEAR REASON THE SURGEON CHANGED HIS MIND AND WANTED A SLOWER VACUUM INCREASE PAIRED WITH A HIGH TOP END VACUUM. AT THAT TIME DORC HAD CLEARLY COMMUNICATED THAT THE REQUESTED SETTINGS COULD LEAD TO PROBLEMS. NEVERTHELESS THE SURGEON INSISTED AND THEREFORE DORC PROGRAMMED THE SETTINGS AS AGREED. THESE SETTINGS IN COMBINATION WITH A 2.8MM PHACO TIP HAD LED TO SURGES AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THE CAPSULAR RUPTURE. INTERFACE PLATE-THE ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED INTERFACE PLATE SHOWS THAT THE LED PCB, HAD LIGHTED UP THE LED-MODULE, AND HAD BEEN IN CONTACT WITH FLUID. THE FLUID ENTERED THE INTERFACE PLATE AFTER CLEANING WITH A TOO WET CLOTH. THIS HAD CAUSED A SHORT CIRCUIT WHICH HAD LED TO THE PUMP MODULE TO GO IN OFF-LINE MODE. HACO PERFORMANCE. THE SURGEON IS NOW USING 2.5MM PHACO TIP IN COMBINATION WITH HIGH VACUUM 550 MMHG. THIS COMBINATION HAS A NEGLIGIBLE SURGE RISK.

COMPLAINTS (B)(4) APPEAR TO SHOW A KNOWN PHENOMENA WITH THIS PACKAGING TYPE, SPECIFICALLY THE SEAL APPEARS TO HAVE EXHIBITED CREEP, LIKELY DURING THE STERILIZATION PROCESS. DURING THIS PROCESS, BOTH HIGH TEMPERATURE AND A PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL (INTERNAL OF THE TRAY AT HIGHER PRESSURE TRANSIENTLY THAN THE CHAMBER) ARE MAINTAINED. ALTHOUGH THE POROSITY OF THE TYVEK® ALLOWS EQUALIZATION, IT IS KNOWN THAT THE SEAL CAN CREEP DURING THIS PROCESS. IT IS PARTLY FOR THIS REASON THAT A SEAL WIDTH OF 6MM IS SPECIFIED IN THE STANDARD. IN THESE TWO COMPLAINT SAMPLES, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FROM VISUAL INSPECTION TO TELL IF THE CREEP THREATENED THE INTEGRITY OF THE SEAL.

SUCH ARTEFACT'S REPRESENT LOCAL AREAS WHERE THE ADHESIVE IS PREFERENTIALLY RETAINED BY THE TYVEK® AND NOT THE PET-G. THIS SITUATION CAN BE CREATED BY PEEL ANGLE (THE RELATIVE ANGLE OF THE LID AND TRAY DURING PEELING), PEELING FORCE AND SPEED AND OTHER FACTORS.

SURGERY HAD TO BE ABORTED DUE TO THIS EVENT. A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE RETURNED DEVICE FOUND THAT THE GUARANTEE SEALS OF THE MODULE HAD BEEN BROKEN OPEN. TIMING OF THE OPENING OF THE MODULE IS UNCLEAR. WHEN THE RETURNED MODULE WAS TESTED IT COULD IMMEDIATELY BE OBSERVED THAT THE VALVE SET DID NOT WORK PROPERLY AND THE CUTTER DID NOT WORK. FURTHER ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE WHITE VALVE WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. THE CAUSE OF THIS WAS THAT THE VALVE WAS STUCK BY DIRT. THE VALVE WAS THEREFORE NOT RESPONDING AND NO AIR WAS COMING OUT OF CONNECTOR. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL THE USER MUST NOT DO ANY MAINTENANCE, OR CALIBRATION OF THE EVA THAT REQUIRE AN OPENING OF THE DEVICE. ALL MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES THAT REQUIRE OPENING OF THE PROTECTIVE HOUSING HAVE TO BE DONE BY SERVICE PERSONNEL THAT HAS BEEN TRAINED AND AUTHORIZED BY D.O.R.C. INTERNATIONAL. BASED UPON THE FACT THAT TIMING OF THE OPENING OF THE MODULE IS UNCLEAR THE ORIGIN AND TIMING OF THE DIRT ACCUMULATION CAN NOT BE DETERMINED.

DUTCH OPHTHALMIC RESEARCH CENTER (INTERNA,EVA TDC VITRECTOMY PACK VGPC INPUT 27G,"Unit, Phacofragmentation",['Adverse Event Without Identified Device or Use Problem'],['Foreign Body In Patient'],"DURING SURGERY THE SURGEON NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A VERY SMALL PARTICLE RESTING ON THE RETINA. THIS PARTICLE WAS REMOVED WITH THE BACK FLUSH INSTRUMENT. SURGEON WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THIS PARTICLE COULD POSSIBLY COME FROM THE VITRECTOR OR THE FORCEPS BEING USED DURING THIS SURGERY. THIS COMPLAINT FORM IS FROM THE VITRECTOMY ONLY. PATIENT CHECKED NEXT DAY FOR ANY REACTION TO THE PARTICLE - NONE, ALL IS WELL. REGARDING THIS EVENT BOTH A DISPOSABLE MICROFORCEPS AND A VITRECTOMY CUTTER WERE RECEIVED FOR INVESTIGATION. THE PARTICLE WAS NOT RETURNED AS THIS WAS ASPIRATED DURING SURGERY AND NOT RETAINED FOR INVESTIGATION. THE PRODUCTS (I.E. MICROFORCEPS AND VITRECTOMY CUTTER) WERE VISUALLY INSPECTED TO EVALUATE WHETHER THEY WERE THE SOURCE TO THE PARTICLES OBSERVED DURING SURGERY. REGARDING THE VITRECTOMY CUTTER RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION IT WAS NOTED THAT THE SHAFT OF THE CUTTER WAS BENT. HOWEVER, THIS IS EXCLUDED AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF THE PARTICLE IDENTIFIED IN THE PATIENT'S EYE, BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN A DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE EYE DURING A SURGERY. FURTHERMORE, IT CAN NOT BE RULED OUT THAT THIS DAMAGE OCCURRED AFTER SURGERY AND/OR DURING TRANSPORT OF THE DEVICE BACK TO DORC (I.E. ITEMS WERE RETURNED IN A BOX WITHOUT ANY PROTECTION). THOROUGH VISUAL INSPECTION REVEALED A SMALL BURR ON THE INNER FACET OF THE OUTER KNIFE. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, IT IS FORESEEN THAT OCCASIONAL BURRS WILL FORM DURING USE AND IN RARE CASES THESE BURRS MAY SHED DURING SURGERY (SUCH A FAILURE MODE IS COMMON TO ALL RECIPROCATING VITRECTOMY CUTTERS). HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ONLY IN CASE OF A VERY LOW OR LACK OF ASPIRATION DURING A VITRECTOMY PROCEDURE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A BURR TO GET INSIDE AN EYE. NO PROBLEMS WITH FUNCTIONING OF ASPIRATION AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT WERE REPORTED BY THE CUSTOMER. IN ADDITION, DHR REVIEW OF THE VITRECTOMY CUTTER DID NOT SHOW ANY DEVIATIONS. AS THE PARTICLE OBSERVED DURING SURGERY WAS ASPIRED BY THE SURGEON AND NOT RETAINED FOR INVESTIGATION, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CLEARLY DETERMINE IF THE PARTICLE ORIGINATED FROM THE INSTRUMENT INVESTIGATED. IN CONCLUSION, THE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS DO NOT LEAD TO A CLEAR CONCLUSION ABOUT THE CAUSE OF THE REPORTED ADVERSE EVENT.",DUTCH OPHTHALMIC RESEARCH CENTER,EVA
