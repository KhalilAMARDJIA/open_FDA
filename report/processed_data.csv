THE DEVICE WITH THE LENS WAS RETURNED INSIDE THE BLISTER TRAY. THE PLUNGER LOCK AND LENS STOP HAVE BEEN REMOVED. THE PLUNGER WAS ORIENTED CORRECTLY. AN ABUNDANCE OF VISCOELASTIC WAS OBSERVED IN THE DEVICE. THE PLUNGER HAS ADVANCED THE LENS TO MID NOZZLE. THE PLUNGER TIP WAS CORRECTLY ENGAGED TO THE TRAILING OPTIC EDGE.

THE PLUNGER WAS ENGAGED TO THE OPTIC TRAILING EDGE UPON RETURN. DURING CLEANING AND REMOVAL OF THE VISCOELASTIC FROM THE NOZZLE, TRAILING OPTIC EDGE DAMAGE AND BROKEN LEADING HAPTIC TIP DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED. THIS MAY SUGGEST A PREVIOUS PLUNGER OVERRIDE HAD OCCURRED RESULTING IN THE OBSERVED LENS DAMAGE. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT CANNOT BE DETERMINED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED. THE INSTRUCTION FOR USE (IFU) INSTRUCTS: DURING DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION OF THE COMPANY INTRA OCULAR LENS (IOL) WITH THE COMPANY PRELOADED DELIVERY SYSTEM, AN COMPANY QUALIFIED OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICE (OVD) SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION STEPS. AN ABUNDANCE OF VISCOELASTIC WAS OBSERVED. THIS MAY SUGGEST THAT THE DEVICE WAS OVERFILLED. PER THE IFU: FULLY INSERT THE OVD CANNULA, PERPENDICULAR TO THE DEVICE, THROUGH THE VISCOELASTIC PORT, LOCATED IN THE LENS STOP PORTION OF THE DEVICE. FILL THE DEVICE UNTIL OVD CAN BE OBSERVED FLOWING TO THE FILL TO LINE ON THE NOZZLE TIP, THEN RETRACT THE CANNULA. THIS WILL REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY 0.2 ML OF OVD. ONLY USE AN COMPANY OVD QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH THE COMPANY PRE-LOADED DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO COME TO THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: TAKE AT LEAST 7 SECONDS TO GENTLY FOLD THE IOL BY ADVANCING THE PLUNGER FORWARD IN ONE SMOOTH, CONTINUOUS MOTION UNTIL THE FRONT EDGE OF THE OPTIC IS EVEN WITH THE FILL TO LINE ON THE NOZZLE. DO NOT ALLOW ANY PORTION OF THE LENS TO EXIT THE NOZZLE TIP. AT THIS POSITION THE BLUE SPRING WILL CONTACT THE CLEAR MAIN BODY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOT ADVANCE THE PLUNGER ABRUPTLY TO FOLD THE IOL AS IMPROPER FOLDING AND LENS DAMAGE MAY OCCUR. PLUNGER OVERRIDE MAY OCCUR: DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENT FASTER THAN THE IFU RECOMMENDED RATE. DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF NON-QUALIFIED OVDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING OF THE HAPTICS, OR OTHER INCONSISTENT FOLDING OUTCOMES. IF THE DEVICE IS OVERFILLED WITH OVD, THIS CAN PREVENT THE TRAILING HAPTIC FROM BEING PLACED PROPERLY OR MOVE THE LENS OUT OF POSITION RESULTING IN MISFOLDING. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (GREATER THAN 23 DEGREE CENTIGRADE / 73 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT.

MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF NON-QUALIFIED OVDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING OF THE HAPTICS, OR OTHER INCONSISTENT FOLDING OUTCOMES. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME STUCK IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO OVERRIDE THE LENS. IF THE DEVICE IS OVERFILLED WITH OVD, THIS CAN PREVENT THE TRAILING HAPTIC FROM BEING PLACED PROPERLY OR MOVE THE LENS OUT OF POSITION RESULTING IN MISFOLDING. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (GREATER THAN 23 DEGREE CENTIGRADE / 73 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT.

STRAIGHT LEADING HAPTICS ARE NOT A PRODUCT MALFUNCTION. THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE POSITION PER THE DIAGRAMS PROVIDED IN THE IFU. A STRAIGHT LEADING HAPTIC MAY OCCUR: DUE TO THE NORMAL FOLDING VARIATIONS AS INDICATED THE IFU DIAGRAMS. IF THE INITIAL PLUNGER ADVANCEMENT IS FASTER THAN THE RECOMMENDED TARGET, THE LEADING HAPTIC MAY BE FORCED PAST THE INTERNAL FOLDING FEATURE. IF THE OVD FILL RATE IS TOO FAST THE FOLDING EFFECT ON THE LEADING HAPTIC IS MINIMIZED. IF THERE IS EXCESSIVE DELAY BETWEEN THE DEVICE PREPARATION AND SUBSEQUENT DELIVERY THE LEADING HAPTIC MAY START TO UNFOLD. DUE TO THE USE OF A NON QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF NON QUALIFIED OVDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING OF THE HAPTICS, OR OTHER INCONSISTENT FOLDING OUTCOMES. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH ( MORE THAN 23DEGREE C OR 73DEGREE F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT OR CONTRIBUTE TO INCORRECT HAPTIC FOLDING.

THE FILE INDICATES THE USE OF A QUALIFIED CARTRIDGE AND HANDPIECE WITH A NONQUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. LENS DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT MAY BE RELATED TO A FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION FOR USE (IFU). THE VISCOELASTIC INDICATED IS NOT QUALIFIED FOR THE LENS OR MONARCH COMBINATION USED. COMPANY FOLDABLE INTRA OCULAR LENS (IOLS) ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM (HANDPIECE AND CARTRIDGE) AND OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) COMBINATION. THE IFU INSTRUCTS THAT AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND VISCOELASTIC COMBINATION SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED COMBINATION MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: USING HOLDING FORCEPS, GRASP THE LENS BY THE OPTIC EDGE AND GENTLY PLACE THE LENS ANTERIOR SIDE UP INTO THE BACK OF THE OVD FILLED CARTRIDGE. THE LENS SHOULD BE INSERTED UNTIL THE OPTIC IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY INSIDE THE CARTRIDGE. USE THE HOLDING FORCEPS TO GENTLY PUSH DOWN ON THE LENS, VERIFYING THAT THE LENS IS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE. USING HOLDING FORCEPS, TAKE THE TRAILING HAPTIC, AND GENTLY FOLD THE HAPTIC ONTO THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE OPTIC. SLOWLY GRIP OR PUSH THE OPTIC EDGE TO POSITION THE LENS AS FAR INTO THE CARTRIDGE AS THE FORCEPS WILL PERMIT, WHILE ENSURING THE LENS REMAINS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE AND THE TRAILING HAPTIC REMAINS ON THE OPTIC. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY CAUSING DELIVERY ISSUES AND OR DAMAGE.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED IN D.9., H.3., H.6. AND H.11. THE LENS WAS RETURNED OUTSIDE THE FULL ASSEMBLED LENS CASE, ADHERED BY SOLUTION TO THE LENS CASE BASE. SOLUTION WAS DRIED ON THE LENS. THE OPTIC WAS CUT INTO PIECES (SOME PIECES WERE NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION), TYPICAL OF INSERTION AND REMOVAL. BOTH CUT OPTIC PORTIONS HAVE SCRATCHES, CRACKS, AND DEEP SCRAPE MARKS ON THE ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR SIDES OF THE LENS. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND THE DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS WERE NOT PROVIDED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF QUALIFIED PRODUCTS WERE USED. THE REPORTED LENS DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED. ALL LENSES ARE 100 PERCENTAGE INSPECTED FOR COSMETIC ATTRIBUTES AND THE DAMAGE EXHIBITED BY THE RETURNED COMPLAINT SAMPLE WOULD NOT HAVE MET COMPANY RELEASE CRITERIA. BASED ON OUR OBSERVATION, AND THE REVIEW OF MANUFACTURING RECORDS, IT CAN BE REASONABLY CONCLUDED THAT THE DAMAGE IS NOT MANUFACTURING RELATED. DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF SURGICAL SOLUTION AND THE CONDITION OF THE RETURNED SAMPLE, THE DAMAGE IS MOST LIKELY RELATED TO CUSTOMER HANDLING. ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS WERE NOT PROVIDED.

THE IFU INSTRUCTS: COMPANY FOLDABLE IOLS ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM (HANDPIECE AND CARTRIDGE) AND OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) COMBINATION. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) INSTRUCTS THAT AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND VISCOELASTIC COMBINATION SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED COMBINATION MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THE IFU INSTRUCTS TO COMPLETELY FILL THE CARTRIDGE WITH OVD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO LOADING AND DELIVERY OF THE LENS. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOAD THE LENS WITHOUT ADEQUATE OVD IN THE DEVICE. NOT ADEQUATELY FILLING THE DEVICE WITH VISCOELASTIC WILL RESULT IN INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF LENS AND THE LENS FOLD PATH WITH OVD, WHICH MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE. THE IFU INSTRUCTS USING HOLDING FORCEPS, GRASP THE LENS BY THE OPTIC EDGE AND GENTLY PLACE THE LENS ANTERIOR SIDE UP INTO THE BACK OF THE OVD FILLED CARTRIDGE. THE LENS SHOULD BE INSERTED UNTIL THE OPTIC IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY INSIDE THE CARTRIDGE. USE THE HOLDING FORCEPS TO GENTLY PUSH DOWN ON THE LENS, VERIFYING THAT THE LENS IS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE. USING HOLDING FORCEPS, TAKE THE TRAILING HAPTIC, AND GENTLY FOLD THE HAPTIC ONTO THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE OPTIC. SLOWLY GRIP OR PUSH THE OPTIC EDGE TO POSITION THE LENS AS FAR INTO THE CARTRIDGE AS THE FORCEPS WILL PERMIT, WHILE ENSURING THE LENS REMAINS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE AND THE TRAILING HAPTIC REMAINS ON THE OPTIC.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED. ONLY HALF OF THE LENS WAS RETURNED IN THE LENS CASE INSIDE THE OPENED MONARCH POUCH. VISCOELASTIC WAS OBSERVED ON THE LENS PORTION. THE OPTIC HAS BEEN CUT IN HALF ACROSS THE CENTER. FORCEP MARK/CRACKS WERE OBSERVED NEAR THE EDGE AND IN MULTIPLE SPOTS NEAR THE CUT SECTION. THIS APPEARED TO BE REMOVAL DAMAGE. THE REPORTED MARK AFTER DELIVERY MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE PORTION THAT WAS NOT RETURNED. NO DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED IN THE TRAVEL PATH. A USED COMPANY CARTRIDGE WAS ALSO RETURNED IN THE COMPANY POUCH FOR LOT 15913816. INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC WAS OBSERVED IN THE CARTRIDGE. THE CARTRIDGE HAD EVIDENCE OF PLACEMENT INTO A HANDPIECE. THE TIP WAS DAMAGED ON THE RIGHT SIDE. THE USED COMPANY CARTRIDGE WAS CLEANED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. TOP COAT DYE STAIN TESTING WAS CONDUCTED WITH ACCEPTABLE RESULTS FOR THE PRESENCE OF TOP COAT. INTERNAL DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED WITH DISRUPTION IN THE COATING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TIP. COMPLAINT AND PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. THE LENS DAMAGE COULD NOT BE VERIFIED. ONLY HALF OF THE LENS WAS RETURNED. BASED ON EVALUATION OF THE RETURNED CARTRIDGE, THE REPORTED DAMAGE MAY BE RELATED TO A FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU). THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IN THE CARTRIDGE. THE CARTRIDGE TIP WAS ALSO SCRAPED ON THE RIGHT SIDE. THIS MAY INDICATE THE LENS/PLUNGER WERE NOT IN ACCEPTABLE POSITIONS FOR ADVANCEMENT. THE IFU INSTRUCTS TO COMPLETELY FILL THE CARTRIDGE WITH OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO LOADING AND DELIVERY OF THE LENS. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOAD THE LENS WITHOUT ADEQUATE OVD IN THE DEVICE. NOT ADEQUATELY FILLING THE DEVICE WITH VISCOELASTIC WILL RESULT IN INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF LENS AND THE LENS FOLD PATH WITH OVD, WHICH MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: USING HOLDING FORCEPS, GRASP THE LENS BY THE OPTIC EDGE AND GENTLY PLACE THE LENS ANTERIOR SIDE UP INTO THE BACK OF THE OVD-FILLED CARTRIDGE. THE LENS SHOULD BE INSERTED UNTIL THE OPTIC IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF-WAY INSIDE THE CARTRIDGE. USE THE HOLDING FORCEPS TO GENTLY PUSH DOWN ON THE LENS, VERIFYING THAT THE LENS IS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE. USING HOLDING FORCEPS, TAKE THE TRAILING HAPTIC, AND GENTLY FOLD THE HAPTIC ONTO THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE OPTIC. SLOWLY GRIP OR PUSH THE OPTIC EDGE TO POSITION THE LENS AS FAR INTO THE CARTRIDGE AS THE FORCEPS WILL PERMIT, WHILE ENSURING THE LENS REMAINS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE AND THE TRAILING HAPTIC REMAINS ON THE OPTIC. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY CAUSING DELIVERY ISSUES AND/OR DAMAGE. IMPORTANT: THE PLUNGER SHOULD MAKE INITIAL CONTACT WITH THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP. IN THE EVENT THE PLUNGER DOES NOT CONTACT THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP, DO NOT USE THE HANDPIECE AND CONTACT COMPANY. THE HANDPIECE IFU INSTRUCTS: VERIFY THAT THE PLUNGER TIP IS PROPERLY ENGAGING THE LENS OPTIC AND THAT THE LENS MOVES FORWARD AT THE SAME RATE AS THE PLUNGER WHILE SLOWLY ADVANCING THE PLUNGER FORWARD TO AVOID DAMAGING THE LENS. WHEN THE THREADS ON THE KNOB MAKE CONTACT WITH THE BARREL, TURN THE KNOB CLOCKWISE APPROXIMATELY ½ TURN TO ENGAGE THE THREADS AND THEN STOP. THE IOL WILL NOW BE IN THE DWELL POSITION.

SUBSEQUENTLY THE LENS WAS REMOVED DURING INITIAL PROCEDURE AND COMPLETED WITH UNSPECIFIED REPLACEMENT IOL. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED STATING THAT THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY. THE LENS WAS RETURNED POSITIONED INCORRECTLY IN THE LENS CASE INSIDE THE CARTON. VISCOELASTIC WAS DRIED ON THE LENS. ONE HAPTIC WAS BENT IN THE GUSSET AREA. THE ANTERIOR OPTIC SURFACE HAS TWO SCRATCHES AND WAS SCRAPED BETWEEN THE OPTIC CENTER AND THE OPTIC EDGE. THE OPTIC ANTERIOR CENTER WAS CRACKED AND DEEPLY GOUGED. A SECOND SMALLER AREA WAS CRACKED NEAR THE ANTERIOR OPTIC CENTER. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED, AND THE DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. ASSOCIATED PRODUCT INFORMATION WAS NOT PROVIDED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF QUALIFIED PRODUCTS WERE USED. THE REPORTED DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED. ALL LENSES ARE 100 PERCENT INSPECTED FOR COSMETIC ATTRIBUTES AND THE DAMAGE EXHIBITED BY THE RETURNED COMPLAINT SAMPLE WOULD NOT HAVE MET COMPANY¿S RELEASE CRITERIA. BASED ON OUR OBSERVATION, IT CAN BE REASONABLY CONCLUDED THAT THE DAMAGE IS NOT MANUFACTURING RELATED. DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF SURGICAL SOLUTION AND THE CONDITION OF THE RETURNED SAMPLE, THE DAMAGE IS MOST LIKELY RELATED TO CUSTOMER HANDLING. IT IS UNKNOWN IF QUALIFIED ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS WERE USED. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) INSTRUCTS: COMPANY FOLDABLE INTRAOCULAR LENSES (IOLS) ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM (HANDPIECE AND CARTRIDGE) AND OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) COMBINATION. THE IFU INSTRUCTS THAT A COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND VISCOELASTIC COMBINATION SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED COMBINATION MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: USING HOLDING FORCEPS, GRASP THE LENS BY THE OPTIC EDGE AND GENTLY PLACE THE LENS ANTERIOR SIDE UP INTO THE BACK OF THE OVD-FILLED CARTRIDGE. THE LENS SHOULD BE INSERTED UNTIL THE OPTIC IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF-WAY INSIDE THE CARTRIDGE. USE THE HOLDING FORCEPS TO GENTLY PUSH DOWN ON THE LENS, VERIFYING THAT THE LENS IS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE. USING HOLDING FORCEPS, TAKE THE TRAILING HAPTIC, AND GENTLY FOLD THE HAPTIC ONTO THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE OPTIC. SLOWLY GRIP OR PUSH THE OPTIC EDGE TO POSITION THE LENS AS FAR INTO THE CARTRIDGE AS THE FORCEPS WILL PERMIT, WHILE ENSURING THE LENS REMAINS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE AND THE TRAILING HAPTIC REMAINS ON THE OPTIC. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY CAUSING DELIVERY ISSUES AND/OR DAMAGE. IT IS UNKNOWN IF AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF VISCOELASTIC WAS USED IN THE CARTRIDGE. THE IFU INSTRUCTS TO COMPLETELY FILL THE CARTRIDGE WITH OVD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO LOADING AND DELIVERY OF THE LENS. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOAD THE LENS WITHOUT ADEQUATE OVD IN THE DEVICE. NOT ADEQUATELY FILLING THE DEVICE WITH VISCOELASTIC WILL RESULT IN INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF LENS AND THE LENS FOLD PATH WITH OVD, WHICH MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE. IT IS UNKNOWN IF THE HANDPIECE WAS IN THE CORRECT ALIGNMENT WITH THE LENS DURING DELIVERY. IMPORTANT: THE PLUNGER SHOULD MAKE INITIAL CONTACT WITH THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP. IN THE EVENT THE PLUNGER DOES NOT CONTACT THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP, DO NOT USE THE HANDPIECE AND CONTACT COMPANY. VERIFY THAT THE PLUNGER TIP IS PROPERLY ENGAGING THE LENS OPTIC AND THAT THE LENS MOVES FORWARD AT THE SAME RATE AS THE PLUNGER WHILE SLOWLY ADVANCING THE PLUNGER FORWARD TO AVOID DAMAGING THE LENS. WHEN THE THREADS ON THE KNOB MAKE CONTACT WITH THE BARREL, TURN THE KNOB CLOCKWISE APPROXIMATELY HALF TURN TO ENGAGE THE THREADS AND THEN STOP. THE IOL WILL NOW BE IN THE DWELL POSITION. INSPECT TO ENSURE THE PLUNGER IS BEHIND THE OPTIC. DUE DILIGENCE HAS BEEN PERFORMED IN AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS EVENT.

PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND THE DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. VISCOELASTIC INFORMATION WAS NOT PROVIDED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED. THE ROOT CAUSE CANNOT BE DETERMINED FOR THE REPORT COMPLAINT OF ¿THE PROXIMAL LOOP GOT STUCK IN THE INJECTOR, TWISTED AND REMAINED STRETCHED¿. THE USED LENS WAS RETURNED OUTSIDE THE USED DEVICE WITH ONE BENT HAPTIC. THE PLUNGER WAS RETRACTED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: DURING DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION OF THE COMPANY PRELOADED DELIVERY SYSTEM, A COMPANY QUALIFIED OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICE (OVD) SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION STEPS. IT IS UNKNOWN IF THE LENS, HAPTICS AND PLUNGER WERE IN ACCEPTABLE POSITIONS FOR ADVANCEMENT DURING DELIVERY ATTEMPT. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: AFTER THE LENS HAS BEEN ADVANCED TO THE ¿FILL-TO¿ LINE, THE LENS SHOULD BE VISUALLY INSPECTED TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE HAPTICS. THE PLUNGER SHOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE TRAILING OPTIC EDGE. NO PART OF THE LENS SHOULD EXIT THE NOZZLE PRIOR TO INSERTION THROUGH THE INCISION. ONCE THE LENS IS IN POSITION AT THE ¿FILL-TO¿ LINE, IT SHOULD BE IMPLANTED WITHIN 3 MINUTES. PROCEEDING WITH IMPLANTATION OF A MISFOLDED HAPTIC OR A LENS THAT APPEARS TO BE ¿OUT OF POSITION¿ CAN RESULT IN A BROKEN HAPTIC OR OTHER NEGATIVE OUTCOME, SINCE THE HAPTIC MAY BE TRAPPED AND STRETCHED, AND/OR PINCHED AND SHEARED BY THE MOVING PLUNGER. THE TRAILING HAPTIC MAY BECOME STUCK: IF THE PLUNGER IS NOT FULLY ADVANCED THE HAPTIC MAY NOT RELEASE PROPERLY FROM THE DEVICE DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION STEPS. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23C / 73 F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT. THE INFORMATION INDICATED THAT A SECOND LENS WAS USED TO COMPLETE THE SURGERY.

THE VISCOELASTIC INDICATED IS NOT QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH THIS IOL, WITH THE USE OF ANY QUALIFIED LENS/CARTRIDGE/HANDPIECE COMBINATION. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT MAY BE RELATED TO A FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU). THE VISCOELASTIC INDICATED IS NOT QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH THIS IOL, WITH THE USE OF ANY QUALIFIED LENS/CARTRIDGE/HANDPIECE COMBINATION. THE IFU INSTRUCTS THAT AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND VISCOELASTIC COMBINATION SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED COMBINATION MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: USING HOLDING FORCEPS, GRASP THE LENS BY THE OPTIC EDGE AND GENTLY PLACE THE LENS ANTERIOR SIDE UP INTO THE BACK OF THE OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICES (OVD) FILLED CARTRIDGE. THE LENS SHOULD BE INSERTED UNTIL THE OPTIC IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF-WAY INSIDE THE CARTRIDGE. USE THE HOLDING FORCEPS TO GENTLY PUSH DOWN ON THE LENS, VERIFYING THAT THE LENS IS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE. USING HOLDING FORCEPS, TAKE THE TRAILING HAPTIC, AND GENTLY FOLD THE HAPTIC ONTO THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE OPTIC. SLOWLY GRIP OR PUSH THE OPTIC EDGE TO POSITION THE LENS AS FAR INTO THE CARTRIDGE AS THE FORCEPS WILL PERMIT, WHILE ENSURING THE LENS REMAINS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE AND THE TRAILING HAPTIC REMAINS ON THE OPTIC. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY CAUSING DELIVERY ISSUES AND/OR DAMAGE.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN B.5.,D.9.,H.3., H.6., AND H.11. THE DEVICE AND THE LENS WERE RETURNED. THE PLUNGER LOCK AND LENS STOP HAVE BEEN REMOVED. THE PLUNGER WAS ORIENTED CORRECTLY. VISCOELASTIC IS OBSERVED IN THE DEVICE. THE PLUNGER WAS RETRACTED TO MID-NOZZLE. NO DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED TO THE DEVICE. THE LENS WAS RETURNED OUTSIDE THE DEVICE. BOTH HAPTICS WERE IN EXPECTED NORMAL POSITIONS AHEAD AND BEHIND THE OPTIC. THE LENS WAS CLEANED WITH KLRP TO FURTHER EVALUATE. ONE HAPTIC WAS CRACKED FROM THE EDGE INWARD AT THE HAPTIC/OPTIC JUNCTION OUTER ANTERIOR EDGE. THIS HAPTIC ALSO HAS SMALL CRACKS ON THE ANTERIOR INNER EDGE OF THE HAPTIC/OPTIC JUNCTION. THE UNDAMAGED HAPTIC WAS EASILY PLIABLE USING TWEEZERS. THE DAMAGED HAPTIC WAS CAREFULLY EVALUATED. THIS HAPTIC WAS ALSO PLIABLE USING TWEEZERS. A FOLD TEST WAS CONDUCTED USING FOLDING TWEEZERS. THE LENS FOLDED AND UNFOLDED WITH NO ABNORMALITIES OBSERVED. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND THE DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED. ONE HAPTIC WAS TORN AND STILL ATTACHED. THE REPORTED HAPTIC ISSUE MAY HAVE BEEN PERTAINING TO THIS DAMAGED HAPTIC. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT MAY BE RELATED TO A FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE IFU (INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE). A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: DURING DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION OF THE COMPANY IOL WITH THE PRELOADED DELIVERY SYSTEM, AN COMPANY QUALIFIED OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICE (OVD) SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION STEPS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CONFIRM THE POSITION OF THE HAPTICS DURING DELIVERY BECAUSE THE LENS AND THE USED DEVICE WERE RETURNED SEPARATELY. ONE HAPTIC WAS DAMAGED AND THE PLUNGER WAS RETRACTED UPON RETURN. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: AFTER THE LENS HAS BEEN ADVANCED TO THE NOZZLE LINE, THE LENS SHOULD BE VISUALLY INSPECTED TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE HAPTICS. THE PLUNGER SHOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE TRAILING OPTIC EDGE. AFTER CONFIRMING THE LENS IS PROPERLY POSITIONED AND THE HAPTICS ARE FOLDED PROPERLY, PROCEED WITH LENS IMPLANTATION. PROCEEDING WITH IMPLANTATION OF A MISFOLDED HAPTIC OR A LENS THAT APPEARS TO BE ¿OUT OF POSITION¿ CAN RESULT IN A BROKEN HAPTIC OR OTHER NEGATIVE OUTCOME, SINCE THE HAPTIC MAY BE TRAPPED AND STRETCHED, AND/OR PINCHED AND SHEARED BY THE MOVING PLUNGER. BOTH HAPTICS WERE EVALUATED AND EASILY PLIABLE USING TWEEZERS TO MANIPULATE. AN ACCEPTABLE FOLD TEST WAS CONDUCTED WITH FOLDING TWEEZERS. THE LENS FOLDED AND UNFOLDED WITH NO ABNORMALITIES OBSERVED.

IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: TAKE AT LEAST 7 SECONDS TO GENTLY FOLD THE IOL BY ADVANCING THE PLUNGER FORWARD IN ONE SMOOTH, CONTINUOUS MOTION UNTIL THE FRONT EDGE OF THE OPTIC IS EVEN WITH THE ¿FILL-TO¿ LINE ON THE NOZZLE. DO NOT ALLOW ANY PORTION OF THE LENS TO EXIT THE NOZZLE TIP. AT THIS POSITION THE BLUE SPRING WILL CONTACT THE CLEAR MAIN BODY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOT ADVANCE THE PLUNGER ABRUPTLY TO FOLD THE IOL AS IMPROPER FOLDING AND LENS DAMAGE MAY OCCUR.

NEEDED TO EXPLANT THE LENS AND REPLACED WITH ANOTHER UNSPECIFIED LENS ON THE SAME DAY. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED AND RECEIVED STATING THAT THERE WAS NO PATIENT HARM. THE LENS WAS RETURNED POSITIONED INCORRECTLY (POSTERIOR SURFACE UP) INSIDE THE LENS CASE INSIDE THE OPENED PEEL POUCH IN THE CARTON. THE POUCH WAS OPENED, FOLDED AND STAPLED TOGETHER IN THE LENS CARTON. VISCOELASTIC WAS DRIED ON THE LENS. ONE HAPTIC WAS BROKEN IN THE GUSSET AREA (NOT RETURNED). THE OPTIC EDGE WAS BROKEN WITH SPLIT DAMAGE INTO THE OPTIC MATERIAL. SCRATCHES WERE OBSERVED ON THE POSTERIOR IN THE CENTER. THE POSTERIOR CENTER WAS ALSO CRACKED. THE POSTERIOR WAS CRACKED IN THE SHAPE OF AN INSTRUMENT USED TO GRASP THE LENS NEAR THE OPTIC EDGE. THE ANTERIOR OPTIC WAS SCRATCHED NEAR THE EDGE. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. QUALIFIED ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS WERE INDICATED. THE PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COULD NOT IDENTIFY A ROOT CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. THE REPORTED SCRATCH DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED. ADDITIONAL LENS DAMAGE WAS ALSO OBSERVED. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: USING HOLDING FORCEPS, GRASP THE LENS BY THE OPTIC EDGE AND GENTLY PLACE THE LENS ANTERIOR SIDE UP INTO THE BACK OF THE OVD-FILLED CARTRIDGE. THE LENS SHOULD BE INSERTED UNTIL THE OPTIC IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF-WAY INSIDE THE CARTRIDGE. USE THE HOLDING FORCEPS TO GENTLY PUSH DOWN ON THE LENS, VERIFYING THAT THE LENS IS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE. USING HOLDING FORCEPS, TAKE THE TRAILING HAPTIC, AND GENTLY FOLD THE HAPTIC ONTO THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE OPTIC. SLOWLY GRIP OR PUSH THE OPTIC EDGE TO POSITION THE LENS AS FAR INTO THE CARTRIDGE AS THE FORCEPS WILL PERMIT, WHILE ENSURING THE LENS REMAINS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE AND THE TRAILING HAPTIC REMAINS ON THE OPTIC. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY CAUSING DELIVERY ISSUES AND/OR DAMAGE. IT IS UNKNOWN IF ADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC WAS USED. THE IFU INSTRUCTS TO COMPLETELY FILL THE CARTRIDGE WITH OVD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO LOADING AND DELIVERY OF THE LENS. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOAD THE LENS WITHOUT ADEQUATE OVD IN THE DEVICE. NOT ADEQUATELY FILLING THE DEVICE WITH VISCOELASTIC WILL RESULT IN INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF LENS AND THE LENS FOLD PATH WITH OVD, WHICH MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE. SCRATCHES MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE USE OF A COLD VISCOELASTIC THAT HAS NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO ACCLIMATE TO THE RECOMMENDED OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE. THE IFU INSTRUCTS TO ONLY USE A COMPANY OVD QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH THE COMPANY IOL DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO COME TO THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE. PER THE IFU: USE THE COMPANY CARTRIDGE AT OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 18 DEGREE C (64 DEGREE F) AND 23 DEGREE C (73 DEGREE F). IMPORTANT: THE PLUNGER SHOULD MAKE INITIAL CONTACT WITH THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP. IN THE EVENT THE PLUNGER DOES NOT CONTACT THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP, DO NOT USE THE HANDPIECE AND CONTACT COMPANY. THE HANDPIECE IFU INSTRUCTS: VERIFY THAT THE PLUNGER TIP IS PROPERLY ENGAGING THE LENS OPTIC AND THAT THE LENS MOVES FORWARD AT THE SAME RATE AS THE PLUNGER WHILE SLOWLY ADVANCING THE PLUNGER FORWARD TO AVOID DAMAGING THE LENS. WHEN THE THREADS ON THE KNOB MAKE CONTACT WITH THE BARREL, TURN THE KNOB CLOCKWISE APPROXIMATELY ½ TURN TO ENGAGE THE THREADS AND THEN STOP. THE IOL WILL NOW BE IN THE DWELL POSITION.

THE LENS WAS RETURNED ADHERED TO THE UNDERSIDE OF THE LENS CASE LID IN DRIED SOLUTION. VISCOELASTIC WAS DRIED ON THE LENS. THE OPTIC WAS BROKEN (OR CUT) INTO TWO LARGE OPTIC PORTIONS AND ONE SMALLER OPTIC PORTION. ONE OF THE LARGER OPTIC PORTIONS HAD ROUNDED CRACKED DAMAGE SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE TO THE TIP OF AN INSTRUMENT USED TO GRASP THE LENS. THIS CRACKED DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED ON THE ANTERIOR OPTIC SURFACE NEAR THE EDGE AND DIRECTLY OPPOSITE ON THE POSTERIOR OPTIC SURFACE. THE OTHER OPTIC PORTION WAS CRACKED, SPLINTERING OFF FROM THE BROKEN LINE OF DAMAGE IN TWO DIRECTIONS. THE POSTERIOR CENTER OF THE OPTIC HAD AN AREA OF LENS MATERIAL THAT WAS BROKEN. THE DAMAGED LENS MATERIAL FROM THIS AREA WAS NOT RETURNED. A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW AND A NON-CONFORMANCE REVIEW OF THE REPORTED LOT NUMBER WAS CONDUCTED. THE DEVIATION REVIEW DID NOT REVEAL ANY POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT AND ALL CORRESPONDING PRODUCTION RELEASE SPECIFICATIONS DEFINED IN THE DEVICE MASTER RECORD WERE MET.

ALL LENSES ARE 100% INSPECTED FOR COSMETIC ATTRIBUTES AND THE DAMAGE EXHIBITED BY THE RETURNED COMPLAINT SAMPLE WOULD NOT HAVE MET COMPANY¿S RELEASE CRITERIA. BASED ON OUR OBSERVATION, IT CAN BE REASONABLY CONCLUDED THAT THE DAMAGE IS NOT MANUFACTURING RELATED. DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF SURGICAL SOLUTION AND THE CONDITION OF THE RETURNED SAMPLE, THE DAMAGE IS MOST LIKELY RELATED TO CUSTOMER HANDLING. THE INITIAL REPORTER INDICATED THAT THE LENS WAS ALREADY PREPPED TO BE INJECTED, THE DR. NOTICED THAT THE IOL WAS BROKEN SO HE HAS TO REMOVE IT. THE REPORTER DID NOT CLARIFY IF THIS LENS WAS INSERTED INTO THE EYE AND REMOVED, OR IF THE LENS WAS REMOVED FROM THE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR RETURN. THE OPTIC CENTER POSTERIOR DAMAGE IS SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE TO LENS DAMAGE FROM A HANDPIECE PLUNGER TIP UNDERRIDING THE LENS DURING ADVANCEMENT. IMPORTANT: THE PLUNGER SHOULD MAKE INITIAL CONTACT WITH THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP. IN THE EVENT THE PLUNGER DOES NOT CONTACT THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP, DO NOT USE THE HANDPIECE AND CONTACT COMPANY. THE HANDPIECE IFU INSTRUCTS: VERIFY THAT THE PLUNGER TIP IS PROPERLY ENGAGING THE LENS OPTIC AND THAT THE LENS MOVES FORWARD AT THE SAME RATE AS THE PLUNGER WHILE SLOWLY ADVANCING THE PLUNGER FORWARD TO AVOID DAMAGING THE LENS. WHEN THE THREADS ON THE KNOB MAKE CONTACT WITH THE BARREL, TURN THE KNOB CLOCKWISE APPROXIMATELY ½ TURN TO ENGAGE THE THREADS AND THEN STOP. THE IOL WILL NOW BE IN THE DWELL POSITION. INSPECT TO ENSURE THE PLUNGER IS BEHIND THE OPTIC. IT IS UNKNOWN IF A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: COMPANY FOLDABLE IOLS ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH A COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM (HANDPIECE AND CARTRIDGE) AND OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) COMBINATION. THE IFU INSTRUCTS THAT A COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND VISCOELASTIC COMBINATION SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED COMBINATION MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: USING HOLDING FORCEPS, GRASP THE LENS BY THE OPTIC EDGE AND GENTLY PLACE THE LENS ANTERIOR SIDE UP INTO THE BACK OF THE OVD-FILLED CARTRIDGE. THE LENS SHOULD BE INSERTED UNTIL THE OPTIC IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF-WAY INSIDE THE CARTRIDGE. USE THE HOLDING FORCEPS TO GENTLY PUSH DOWN ON THE LENS, VERIFYING THAT THE LENS IS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE. USING HOLDING FORCEPS, TAKE THE TRAILING HAPTIC, AND GENTLY FOLD THE HAPTIC ONTO THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE OPTIC. SLOWLY GRIP OR PUSH THE OPTIC EDGE TO POSITION THE LENS AS FAR INTO THE CARTRIDGE AS THE FORCEPS WILL PERMIT, WHILE ENSURING THE LENS REMAINS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE AND THE TRAILING HAPTIC REMAINS ON THE OPTIC.

ONE HAPTIC WAS FOLDED WITH THE DISTAL TIP ADHERED TO THE ANTERIOR OPTIC SURFACE IN DRIED VISCOELASTIC. THE HAPTICS ARE FULL AND INTACT TO THE OPTIC. THE LENS WAS CLEANED WITH KLRP TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE LENS. AFTER REMOVAL OF THE DRIED VISCOELASTIC, THE FOLDED HAPTIC FULLY RELEASED FROM THE OPTIC INTO THE ORIGINAL POSITION. NO DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED TO THE HAPTICS. NO DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED TO THE OPTIC. PRODUCT HISTORY RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA.

THE REPORTED HAPTIC STUCK IN BETWEEN PLUNGER CANNOT BE CONFIRMED BECAUSE ONLY THE LENS WAS RETURNED IN A LENS CASE. IT IS UNKNOWN IF A QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED IN THE CARTRIDGE. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: COMPANY FOLDABLE IOLS ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM (HANDPIECE AND CARTRIDGE) AND OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) COMBINATION. THE IFU INSTRUCTS THAT AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND VISCOELASTIC COMBINATION SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED COMBINATION MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: USING HOLDING FORCEPS, GRASP THE LENS BY THE OPTIC EDGE AND GENTLY PLACE THE LENS ANTERIOR SIDE UP INTO THE BACK OF THE OVD-FILLED CARTRIDGE. THE LENS SHOULD BE INSERTED UNTIL THE OPTIC IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF-WAY INSIDE THE CARTRIDGE. USE THE HOLDING FORCEPS TO GENTLY PUSH DOWN ON THE LENS, VERIFYING THAT THE LENS IS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE. USING HOLDING FORCEPS, TAKE THE TRAILING HAPTIC, AND GENTLY FOLD THE HAPTIC ONTO THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE OPTIC. SLOWLY GRIP OR PUSH THE OPTIC EDGE TO POSITION THE LENS AS FAR INTO THE CARTRIDGE AS THE FORCEPS WILL PERMIT, WHILE ENSURING THE LENS REMAINS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE AND THE TRAILING HAPTIC REMAINS ON THE OPTIC. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY CAUSING DELIVERY ISSUES AND/OR DAMAGE. THE REPORTER INDICATED TO NOT CONTACT THEM.

THE PLUNGER WAS ADVANCED UNDER THE LENS TO MID NOZZLE. THE LENS IS LOCATED ON TOP OF THE PLUNGER STILL IN THE LOADING AREA. THE OPTIC HAD DEEP SCRAPE MARKS IN THE TRAVEL PATH OF THE PLUNGER. A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW AND A NON-CONFORMANCE REVIEW OF THE REPORTED LOT NUMBER WAS CONDUCTED. THE DEVIATION REVIEW DID NOT REVEAL ANY POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT AND ALL CORRESPONDING PRODUCTION RELEASE SPECIFICATIONS DEFINED IN THE DEVICE MASTER RECORD WERE MET. A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS INDICATED. A PLUNGER UNDERRIDE WITH LENS DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED. THIS MAY HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED AS THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. THE ROOT CAUSE MAY BE RELATED TO A FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU). AN INADEQUATE AMOUNT OF VISCOELASTIC WAS OBSERVED IN THE DEVICE. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: FILL THE DEVICE UNTIL VISCOELASTIC CAN BE OBSERVED FLOWING TO THE LINE ON THE NOZZLE TIP. THIS WILL REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY 0.2 ML OF VISCOELASTIC. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO UNDERRIDE THE LENS. A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED IN THE DEVICE. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: DURING DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION OF THE COMPANY PRELOADED DELIVERY SYSTEM, AN COMPANY QUALIFIED OPHTHALMIC VISCOELASTIC DEVICE (OVD) SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION STEPS. PLUNGER UNDERRIDE MAY OCCUR DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENT FASTER THAN THE IFU RECOMMEND RATE. IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE, THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO UNDERRIDE THE LENS. DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF NON-QUALIFIED OVDS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERFILL, OVERFILL, MISFOLDING OF THE HAPTICS, OR OTHER INCONSISTENT FOLDING OUTCOMES. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (GREATER THAN 23 DEGREE CELSIUS / 73 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT.

THE LENS WAS POSTERIOR SURFACE UP. ONE HAPTIC TIP WAS VISIBLE OVER THE OPTIC. A SCRATCH OR CRACK WAS OBSERVED NEAR THE OPTIC CENTER. THIS DAMAGE WAS JUST OFF CENTER. THE DAMAGE WAS PERPENDICULAR TO THE TRAVEL PATH. THIS DAMAGE MAY INDICATE A PLUNGER OVER/UNDERRIDE OCCURRED. A QUALIFIED CARTRIDGE AND VISCOELASTIC WERE INDICATED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF A QUALIFIED HANDPIECE WAS USED. THE PRODUCT WAS DISCARDED BY THE FACILITY. BASED ON REVIEW OF THE PROVIDED PHOTO THE LENS HAD A SCRATCH OR A CRACK. THIS DAMAGE WAS JUST OFF CENTER. THE DAMAGE WAS PERPENDICULAR TO THE TRAVEL PATH. THIS DAMAGE MAY INDICATE A PLUNGER OVER/UNDERRIDE OCCURRED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF A QUALIFIED HANDPIECE WAS USED. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: COMPANY FOLDABLE IOLS ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM (HANDPIECE AND CARTRIDGE) AND OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) COMBINATION. THE IFU INSTRUCTS THAT AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND VISCOELASTIC COMBINATION SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED COMBINATION MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: USING HOLDING FORCEPS, GRASP THE LENS BY THE OPTIC EDGE AND GENTLY PLACE THE LENS ANTERIOR SIDE UP INTO THE BACK OF THE OVD-FILLED CARTRIDGE. THE LENS SHOULD BE INSERTED UNTIL THE OPTIC IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF-WAY INSIDE THE CARTRIDGE. USE THE HOLDING FORCEPS TO GENTLY PUSH DOWN ON THE LENS, VERIFYING THAT THE LENS IS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE. USING HOLDING FORCEPS, TAKE THE TRAILING HAPTIC, AND GENTLY FOLD THE HAPTIC ONTO THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE OPTIC. SLOWLY GRIP OR PUSH THE OPTIC EDGE TO POSITION THE LENS AS FAR INTO THE CARTRIDGE AS THE FORCEPS WILL PERMIT, WHILE ENSURING THE LENS REMAINS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE AND THE TRAILING HAPTIC REMAINS ON THE OPTIC. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY CAUSING DELIVERY ISSUES AND/OR DAMAGE. IMPORTANT: THE PLUNGER SHOULD MAKE INITIAL CONTACT WITH THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP. IN THE EVENT THE PLUNGER DOES NOT CONTACT THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP, DO NOT USE THE HANDPIECE AND CONTACT COMPANY. THE HANDPIECE IFU INSTRUCTS: VERIFY THAT THE PLUNGER TIP IS PROPERLY ENGAGING THE LENS OPTIC AND THAT THE LENS MOVES FORWARD AT THE SAME RATE AS THE PLUNGER WHILE SLOWLY ADVANCING THE PLUNGER FORWARD TO AVOID DAMAGING THE LENS. WHEN THE THREADS ON THE KNOB MAKE CONTACT WITH THE BARREL, TURN THE KNOB CLOCKWISE APPROXIMATELY ½ TURN TO ENGAGE THE THREADS AND THEN STOP. THE IOL WILL NOW BE IN THE DWELL POSITION.

THE PLUNGER POSITION IN RELATION TO THE REPORTED BROKEN HAPTIC DURING ADVANCEMENT CANNOT BE DETERMINED. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: AFTER THE LENS HAS BEEN ADVANCED TO THE ¿FILL-TO¿ LINE, THE LENS SHOULD BE VISUALLY INSPECTED TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE HAPTICS. THE PLUNGER SHOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE TRAILING OPTIC EDGE. NO PART OF THE LENS SHOULD EXIT THE NOZZLE PRIOR TO INSERTION THROUGH THE INCISION. ONCE THE LENS IS IN POSITION AT THE FILL TO LINE, IT SHOULD BE IMPLANTED WITHIN 3 MINUTES. PROCEEDING WITH IMPLANTATION OF A MISFOLDED HAPTIC OR A LENS THAT APPEARS TO BE OUT OF POSITION CAN RESULT IN A BROKEN HAPTIC OR OTHER NEGATIVE OUTCOME, SINCE THE HAPTIC MAY BE TRAPPED AND STRETCHED, AND/OR PINCHED AND SHEARED BY THE MOVING PLUNGER. BROKEN HAPTICS MAY OCCUR DUE TO FOLLOWING DUE TO THE USE OF A NON-QUALIFIED VISCOELASTIC. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED OVD MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE DEVICE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION STEPS. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH OR MORE THAN 23 DEGREES CELSIUS OR 73 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT, AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOT ADVANCE THE PLUNGER ABRUPTLY TO FOLD THE IOL AS IMPROPER FOLDING AND LENS DAMAGE MAY OCCUR. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: AFTER THE LENS HAS BEEN ADVANCED TO THE NOZZLE LINE, THE LENS SHOULD BE VISUALLY INSPECTED TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE HAPTICS. THE PLUNGER SHOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE TRAILING OPTIC EDGE. AFTER CONFIRMING THE LENS IS PROPERLY POSITIONED AND THE HAPTICS ARE FOLDED PROPERLY, PROCEED WITH LENS IMPLANTATION. PROCEEDING WITH IMPLANTATION OF A MISFOLDED HAPTIC OR A LENS THAT APPEARS TO BE ¿OUT OF POSITION¿ CAN RESULT IN A BROKEN HAPTIC OR OTHER NEGATIVE OUTCOME, SINCE THE HAPTIC MAY BE TRAPPED AND STRETCHED, AND/OR PINCHED AND SHEARED BY THE MOVING PLUNGER. BROKEN HAPTICS MAY OCCUR: IF INADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC IS PLACED IN THE DEVICE, THIS WILL CAUSE INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF THE LENS FOLD PATH WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY OR BECOME ¿STUCK¿ IN THE DEVICE ALLOWING THE PLUNGER TO UNDERRIDE THE LENS. IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (MORE THAN 23 DEGREE CELSIUS / 73-DEGREE FAHRENHEIT) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT. IN ADDITION, HAPTIC STRENGTH (MODULUS) DECREASES AS THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES AND IS MORE LIKELY TO BREAK UNDER STRESS. IF A STRAIGHT TRAILING HAPTIC OCCURS AND IT WAS NOT PROPERLY DETECTED TO BE OUT OF POSITION. IF THE PLUNGER IS NOT FULLY ADVANCED, OR IF THE PLUNGER IS ALLOWED TO RETRACT, THE TRAILING HAPTIC MAY NOT RELEASE PROPERLY FROM THE DEVICE. ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CAUSES ALONE, OR IN COMBINATION, MAY CREATE THE REPORTED EVENT.

THE IFU INSTRUCTS: COMPANY FOLDABLE INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL)S ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH AN INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM (HANDPIECE AND CARTRIDGE) AND OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) COMBINATION. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU)INSTRUCTS THAT AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND VISCOELASTIC COMBINATION SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED COMBINATION MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. IT IS UNKNOWN IF ADEQUATE VISCOELASTIC WAS USED IN THE ASSOCIATED CARTRIDGE. THE IFU INSTRUCTS TO COMPLETELY FILL THE CARTRIDGE WITH OVD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO LOADING AND DELIVERY OF THE LENS. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOAD THE LENS WITHOUT ADEQUATE OVD IN THE DEVICE. NOT ADEQUATELY FILLING THE DEVICE WITH VISCOELASTIC WILL RESULT IN INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF LENS AND THE LENS FOLD PATH WITH OVD, WHICH MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: USING HOLDING FORCEPS, GRASP THE LENS BY THE OPTIC EDGE AND GENTLY PLACE THE LENS ANTERIOR SIDE UP INTO THE BACK OF THE OVD-FILLED CARTRIDGE. THE LENS SHOULD BE INSERTED UNTIL THE OPTIC IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF-WAY INSIDE THE CARTRIDGE. USE THE HOLDING FORCEPS TO GENTLY PUSH DOWN ON THE LENS, VERIFYING THAT THE LENS IS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE. USING HOLDING FORCEPS, TAKE THE TRAILING HAPTIC, AND GENTLY FOLD THE HAPTIC ONTO THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE OPTIC. SLOWLY GRIP OR PUSH THE OPTIC EDGE TO POSITION THE LENS AS FAR INTO THE CARTRIDGE AS THE FORCEPS WILL PERMIT, WHILE ENSURING THE LENS REMAINS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE AND THE TRAILING HAPTIC REMAINS ON THE OPTIC. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY CAUSING DELIVERY ISSUES AND/OR DAMAGE. IMPORTANT: THE PLUNGER SHOULD MAKE INITIAL CONTACT WITH THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP. IN THE EVENT THE PLUNGER DOES NOT CONTACT THE CARTRIDGE AT THE RAMP, DO NOT USE THE HANDPIECE AND CONTACT COMPANY. THE HANDPIECE IFU INSTRUCTS: VERIFY THAT THE PLUNGER TIP IS PROPERLY ENGAGING THE LENS OPTIC AND THAT THE LENS MOVES FORWARD AT THE SAME RATE AS THE PLUNGER WHILE SLOWLY ADVANCING THE PLUNGER FORWARD TO AVOID DAMAGING THE LENS. WHEN THE THREADS ON THE KNOB MAKE CONTACT WITH THE BARREL, TURN THE KNOB CLOCKWISE APPROXIMATELY HALF TURN TO ENGAGE THE THREADS AND THEN STOP. THE IOL WILL NOW BE IN THE DWELL POSITION.

TWO PHOTOS WERE PROVIDED OF A MONITOR SCREEN WITH THE LENS SHOWN IN THE EYE. PHOTO ONE: A RED ARROW HAS BEEN PLACED INDICATING THE HAPTIC THAT APPEARS TO BE MISFOLDED. THE REPORTED SCRATCH DAMAGE WAS ALSO OBSERVED. PHOTO TWO: SHOWS MORE OF THE OPTIC, BUT NOT THE COMPLETE OPTIC. ONE SET OF TORIC AXIS MARKS ARE VISIBLE IN THE VIEWING AREA. THE SCRATCHED DAMAGE WAS ABLE TO BE SEEN IN THIS PHOTO. A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW AND A NON-CONFORMANCE REVIEW OF THE REPORTED LOT NUMBER WAS CONDUCTED. THE DEVIATION REVIEW DID NOT REVEAL ANY POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT AND ALL CORRESPONDING PRODUCTION RELEASE SPECIFICATIONS DEFINED IN THE DEVICE MASTER RECORD WERE MET. ASSOCIATED PRODUCT INFORMATION WAS NOT PROVIDED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF QUALIFIED ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS WERE USED. BASED ON OUR OBSERVATION OF THE ATTACHED PHOTOS, THE LENS WAS SCRATCHED AND A MISFOLDED HAPTIC WAS OBSERVED. IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE A FINAL DETERMINATION WITHOUT EVALUATION OF THE PHYSICAL SAMPLE. THE ROOT CAUSE CANNOT BE DETERMINED BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. IT IS UNKNOWN IF QUALIFIED ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS WERE USED. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) INSTRUCTS: COMPANY FOLDABLE INTRA OCULAR LENS (IOLS) ARE QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM (HANDPIECE AND CARTRIDGE) AND OPHTHALMIC VISCOSURGICAL DEVICE (OVD) COMBINATION. THE IFU INSTRUCTS THAT AN COMPANY QUALIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND VISCOELASTIC COMBINATION SHOULD BE USED. THE USE OF AN UNQUALIFIED COMBINATION MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LENS AND POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS DURING THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS. THE IFU INSTRUCTS: USING HOLDING FORCEPS, GRASP THE LENS BY THE OPTIC EDGE AND GENTLY PLACE THE LENS ANTERIOR SIDE UP INTO THE BACK OF THE OVD FILLED CARTRIDGE. THE LENS SHOULD BE INSERTED UNTIL THE OPTIC IS A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF WAY INSIDE THE CARTRIDGE. USE THE HOLDING FORCEPS TO GENTLY PUSH DOWN ON THE LENS, VERIFYING THAT THE LENS IS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE. USING HOLDING FORCEPS, TAKE THE TRAILING HAPTIC, AND GENTLY FOLD THE HAPTIC ONTO THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE OPTIC. SLOWLY GRIP OR PUSH THE OPTIC EDGE TO POSITION THE LENS AS FAR INTO THE CARTRIDGE AS THE FORCEPS WILL PERMIT, WHILE ENSURING THE LENS REMAINS ON THE BOTTOM SURFACE OF THE CARTRIDGE AND THE TRAILING HAPTIC REMAINS ON THE OPTIC. FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS MAY CAUSE THE LENS TO ADVANCE INCORRECTLY CAUSING DELIVERY ISSUES AND OR DAMAGE. THE IFU INSTRUCTS TO COMPLETELY FILL THE CARTRIDGE WITH OVD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO LOADING AND DELIVERY OF THE LENS. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LOAD THE LENS WITHOUT ADEQUATE OVD IN THE DEVICE. NOT ADEQUATELY FILLING THE DEVICE WITH VISCOELASTIC WILL RESULT IN INADEQUATE COVERAGE OF LENS AND THE LENS FOLD PATH WITH OVD, WHICH MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE. INFORMATION INDICATED THAT THE AXIS SHIFTED. IT IS UNKNOWN IF THE LENS WAS PLACED AT THE INTENDED AXIS. ROTATION OF THE COMPANY TORIC IOL AWAY FROM ITS INTENDED AXIS CAN REDUCE THE ASTIGMATIC CORRECTION. MISALIGNMENT GREATER THAN 30 DEGREE MAY INCREASE POSTOPERATIVE REFRACTIVE CYLINDER. IF NECESSARY, LENS REPOSITIONING SHOULD OCCUR AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE PRIOR TO LENS ENCAPSULATION. INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED IN THE FILE: HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL SUBMITTED A REPORT OF HAPTIC BENT. A SCRATCH WAS NOTED AT THE OPTIC HAPTIC JUNCTION DURING IMPLANTATION. INITIALLY, IT WAS NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT VISUAL OUTCOMES. AT FOLLOW UP, THE HAPTIC WAS FOUND FOLDED FORWARD, CONTACTING THE IRIS, CAUSING PIGMENT DISPERSION AND ELEVATED INTRA OCULAR PRESSURE (IOP). DR.

THE PATIENT IOP HAS RECOVERED, WITH A VISUAL ACUITY (VA) OF 0.5SC AND A DIOPTER OF +0/-2.75X3, BUT THE LENS INSERTION HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO CORRECT THE CONDITION.

DO NOT ALLOW ANY PORTION OF THE LENS TO EXIT THE NOZZLE TIP. AT THIS POSITION THE BLUE SPRING WILL CONTACT THE CLEAR MAIN BODY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOT ADVANCE THE PLUNGER ABRUPTLY TO FOLD THE IOL AS IMPROPER FOLDING AND LENS DAMAGE MAY OCCUR. A PLUNGER OVERRIDER MAY OCCUR: ¿ DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENT FASTER THAN THE IFU RECOMMENDED RATE. ¿ IF THE OPERATING ROOM TEMPERATURE IS TOO HIGH (> 23°C / 73° F) LENS FOLDING CONSISTENCY IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, THE LENS IS MORE ADHERENT AND THIS MAY INHIBIT LENS ADVANCEMENT.
