THEN, THE SET WERE ASSESSED USING ECME NAIL FROM QUALITY CONTROL DEPARTMENT. THE ISSUE DETECTED DURING THE SURGERY WAS NOT RECREATED. AS ASSESSED BY THE R&D DEPARTMENT, NO ISSUE WAS DETECTED ON THE SET ALSO THE DESIGN IS NOT QUESTIONED. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE SALES REPRESENTATIVE INDICATES THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT. NO ISSUE OCCURRED DURING THE TARGETING JIG ASSEMBLY. THEN, ACCORDING TO THE SURGICAL TECHNIQUE REFERENCE ST-DIG-TRIWAY-EU-EN-082023, AFTER THE NAIL INSERTION, SUBTALAR SCREW MUST BE PREPARED BY INSERTING A K-WIRE AND A K-WIRE GUIDE. THIS INSTRUMENT MUST STAY DURING THE CALCANEAL SCREW PREPARATION AND INSERTION. IN THIS CASE, THE K-WIRE FROM THE SUBTALAR SCREW PREPARATION WAS REMOVED BY THE SURGEON BEFORE THE CALCANEAL SCREW INSERTION.

THE ORIGINAL EMAIL FROM THIS SURGEON, (B)(6) WAS SENT ON (B)(6) 2025 TO GEOFF FRAMPTON THE CLINICAL SALES MANAGER AT CONMED USA. (B)(6)Y HAS WRITTEN: ""I HAVE A CONCERNING TREND I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING FOR QUITE SOME TIME BUT I ACTUALLY WENT BACK IN THE ARCHIVE AND LOOKED THESE UP. OVER THE COURSE OF JUST OVER 2 YEARS I HAVE DONE 24 QUANTUM BASED OFF MY OWN INTERNAL REVIEW 7 HAVE BEEN FAILURES.

THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. I AM GOING TO PAUSE USE OF THE QUANTUM UNTIL I HAVE A BETTER HOLD OF WHY THIS IS OR IF THERE IS SOME INTERNAL REVIEW FROM I2B THAT PROVIDES SOLUTIONS.

THE SURGEON HASN'T ANSWERED. THE BATCHES NUMBERS ARE UNKNOWN. ANALYSIS OF THE POST-OPERATION X-RAYS SHOWS THE EVENTS DESCRIBED: ANTERIOR TIBIAL SUBSIDENCE. ACCORDING TO THE SURGEON, SIDE EFFECTS ARE ALWAYS ON THE TIBIAL SIDE: AN ANTERIOR TIBIAL SUBSIDENCE IN THE SAGITTAL PLANE WITH RESORPTION. THIS FAILURE MODE IS KNOWN AND THE CAPA2303-31 WAS ALREADY OPENED ON (B)(6) 2023. THE INVESTIGATION' RESULTS OF THIS CAPA DON'T QUESTIONED THE DESIGN OF THE PROSTHESIS BY THE INCIDENTS REPORTED. HOWEVER, IT APPEARS THAT SOME DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS ARE POSSIBLE ON THE REUSABLE INSTRUMENTS INTENDED TO BE USED TO PREPARE THE TIBIAL CROSS, TO PLACE AND IMPACT THE PROSTHESIS. A DESIGN MODIFICATION WAS ALREADY OPENED UNDER THE REFERENCE (B)(4) AS PART OF PREVENTIVE AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IDENTIFIED THROUGH CAPA2303-31. THE AIM OF THIS DESIGN MODIFICATION WAS TO MODIFY INSTRUMENTS USED DURING SURGERY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A FULLY AXIAL BONE PREPARATION AND IMPLANTATION OF THE FINAL TIBIAL IMPLANT, TO GET IMMEDIATE FEELING OF TIBIAL IMPLANT PRIMARY STABILITY INTRA-OPERATIVELY. THE DESIGN OF THE INSTRUMENTS USED MIGHT EXPLAINT THE COMPLAINT. THE DESIGN OF THE IMPLANT IS NOT QUESTIONED. THE DESIGN MODIFICATION (B)(4) WAS CLOSED IN (B)(6) 2025 AND THE NEW INSTRUMENTS WERE RELEASED IN (B)(6) 2025. AS THE SURGEON REPORTED THE SURGERY OCCURRED OVER 2 YEARS, WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT THE ""OLD"" INSTRUMENTS WERE USED. THIS USE COULD EXPLAIN THE ANTERIOR TIBIAL SUBSIDENCE OBSERVED AFTER 6 MONTHS POST SURGERY. MOREOVER, SEVERAL PROBABLE CAUSES WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE CAPA2303-31 (SUCH AS THE BONE QUALITY AND COMORBIDITY OF THE PATIENT AND THE REEDUCATION PERFORMED). THE ACTIONS OF THIS CAPA ARE ALL PERFORMED AND THE EFFECTIVENESS CHECK IS IN PROGRESS. TO CONCLUDE, INVESTIGATION OF THESE EVENTS SHOW THAT: · BATCH NUMBERS ARE UNKNOWN · X-RAY ANALYSIS CONFIRMS ANTERIOR TIBIAL SUBSIDENCE · THE FAILURE MODE IS KNOWN AND CAPA2303-31 WAS OPENED ON MARCH 2023 · DESIGN MODIFICATION (B)(4) WAS OPENED IN (B)(6) 2023 TO MODIFY THE INSTRUMENTS USED DURING SURGERY · THE IMPLANTS ARE NOT QUESTIONED · NEW INSTRUMENTS WERE RELEASED ON (B)(6)2025 · SURGERIES HAPPENED OVER 2 YEARS ALSO ""OLD"" INSTRUMENTS WERE USED THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EVENTS IS A POOR BONE PREPARATION DUE TO THE DESIGN OF INSTRUMENTS USED FOR THE BONE PREPARATION.",IN2BONS SAS,QUANTUM
