THE INSTRUMENT LOOKS NORMAL AROUD THE BREAKAGE AREA. HOWEVER, IT SHOWS SIGNS OF IMPACTION ON A SPOT WHERE IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED, WHICH EXPLAINS THE BREAKAGE OBSERVED. INDEED, IT APPEARS IT WAS HIT ON THE SIDES INSTEAD OF BEING HIT, AS INTENDED, ON THE CENTER PART TO COMPRESSS THE NAIL INTO THE BONE VERTICALLY. A DEDICATED INSTRUMENT (MASSELOTTE) IS SUPPLIED IN THE TRIWAY SYSTEM TO SPECIFICALLY ENABLE A CENTERED IMPACTION, BUT IT WAS NOT USED BY THE SURGEON. THE ASSOCIATED INSTRUCTION IS CLEARLY PICTURED IN THE SURGICAL TECHNIQUE. THIS IS THE FIRST OCCURRENCE OF ANY TYPE OF INCIDENT LINKED TO THIS INSTRUMENT SINCE THE SYSTEM WAS FIRST CLEARED IN 2018. THIS INCIDENT BEING THE FIRST OCCURRENCE AND CLEARLY BEING LINKED TO USER ERROR, NO FIELD ACTION IS DEEMED NECESSARY. IN2BONES SAS WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND RECORD SUCH EVENTS, IF ANY. THIS EMDR WAS INITIALLY PREPARED AND SENT TO FDA IN 2019 (INITIAL REPORT ON JUNE 07). A FAILURE OCCURRED IN WEBTRADER ELECTRONIC FILING SYSTEM BUT THIS WAS NOT DETECTED BY IN2BONES SAS IMMEDIATELY. IN NOVEMBER 2020, A WEBTRADER CERTIFICATE ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND, AT THE SAME TIME, IN2BONES DISCOVERED THE MESSAGES INDICATING THE RECEPTION FAILURES OF SOME EMDRS. IN CONSEQUENCE, THESE EMDRS WERE CORRECTED AND ARE NOW BEING FILED RETROSPECTIVELY."

REVISION OF FAILED ANKLE ARTHRODESIS WITH SUBTALAR INVOLVEMENT OR WITH INSUFFICIENT TALAR BODY. REVISION OF FAILED TOTAL ANKLE ARTHROPLASTY WITH SUBTALAR INTRUSION.

NEUROARTHROPATHY OR NEUROMUSCULAR DEFORMITY OR OTHER NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASE WITH SEVERE DEFORMITY OR INSTABILITY OF THE ANKLE, INCLUDING CHARCOT FOOT. SEVERE PILON FRACTURES WITH TRAUMA TO THE SUBTALAR JOINT. MALUNITED TIBIAL PILON FRACTURES THE IN2BONES TRIWAY\u00bf TTC ARTHRODESIS NAIL HAS TO BE FIXED WITH THE ASSOCIATED: TIBIAL FIXATION USING COTTER SCREWS DIAMETER 5.0MM ; TALAR FIXATION USING COTTER SCREWS DIAMETER 5.0MM ; CALCANEUS FIXATION USING COTTER SCREWS DIAMETER 5.0MM. THE ADDITION OF AN IBS\" 6.5MM COMPRESSION SCREW THROUGH THE SUBTALAR JOINT AND THROUGH THE NAIL IS REQUIRED. ALL SCREWS ARE INTENDED TO BE IMPLATED THROUGH THE NAIL THANKS TO A DEDICATED TARGETING JIG. TO PERFORM THE COMPRESSION MANEUVER OF THE TIBIOTALO JOINT, THE SURGEON HAMMERED THE JIG AND THE HITTING PLATE BROKE OFF INTO THE CONNECTOR (BOTH COMPONENTS BEING PARTS OF THE JIG). AFTER THIS HAPPENED, THE SURGEON COMMENTED THAT THE JIG HAD APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 15 DEGREES OF PLAY. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE SURGEON WAS UNABLE TO ACCURATELY LINE UP THE JIG WITH THE PROXIMAL NAIL HOLES AND COULD NOT ADVANCE THE 5.0 MM TRIWAY SCREWS THROUGH THE TIBIAL NAIL HOLES. HE WAS ABLE TO GET THE DRILL INTO THE NAIL HOLE BUT NOT THE SCREW. THE SURGEON, HAVING DIFFICULTIES INSERTING THE SCREWS IN THE NAIL, DECIDED TO USE OTHER SCREWS (OF THE SAME DIAMETER) HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT PART OF THE TRIWAY SYSTREM, AND WERE USED OFF-LABEL. THE SURGERY DURATION WAS EXTENDED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. THE HITTING PLATE IS A NON-INVASIVE INSTRUMENT, AND THE BROKEN PART OR ANY METALLIC DEBRIS COULD NOT COME IN CONTACT WITH THE PATIENT. THE SURGEON STATED THE POST-OPERATIVE X-RAYS LOOKED GOOD. THERE WAS NO OTHER CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES APART FROM THE EXTENSION OF THE SURGERY DURATION."

THIS IS THE SECOND OCCURRENCE OF ANY TYPE OF INCIDENT LINKED TO THIS INSTRUMENT SINCE THE SYSTEM WAS FIRST CLEARED IN 2018. THIS EVENT IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS NOT BEING ADEQUATELY FOLLOWED. THE SURGICAL TECHNIQUE MANUAL INDEED INCLUDES A STATEMENT THAT THE TIBIAL CANAL SHOULD BE REAMED 1MM ABOVE THE DESIRED NAIL DIAMETER. IF THIS STEP IS CARRIED OUT, NO SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS ARE REQUIRED TO IMPACT THE NAIL IN PLACE. ONLY FINAL ADJUSTMENT IS TO BE MADE WITH IMPACTION ON THE HITTING PLATE. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE RISK OF MALFUNCTION WHEN SURGICAL TECHNIQUE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT FOLLOWED, A CHANGE CONTROL IS BEING IMPLEMENTED TO CHANGE THE HEAT TREATMENT APPLIED ON THIS INSTRUMENT, AND TO IMPROVE ITS RESISTANCE TO BREAKAGE. THE ENGINEERING DRAWING WAS REVISED ON MAY 27, 2019. THE INSTRUMENT INVOLVED WAS MANUFACTURED BEFORE THE CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION. NO FIELD ACTION IS DEEMED NECESSARY. IN2BONES SAS WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND RECORD SUCH EVENTS, IF ANY. A PREVIOUS OCCURRENCE OF A SIMILAR PROBLEM (MEDWATCH REPORT 3010470577-2019-05051) CAUSED A ONE-HOUR INCREASE IN THE SURGERY DURATION AND WAS THEREFORE REPORTED. THIS IS THE REASON WHY THIS SECOND OCCURRENCE IS ALSO REPORTED : EVEN IF IT DID NOT HAVE ANY CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PATIENT, IN2BONES CONSIDERED IT COULD LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SURGERY DURATION IF IT WERE TO RECUR. THIS EMDR WAS INITIALLY PREPARED AND SENT TO FDA IN 2019 (COMBINED REPORT SENT ON AUGUST 08TH, 2019). A FAILURE OCCURRED IN WEBTRADER ELECTRONIC FILING SYSTEM BUT THIS WAS NOT DETECTED BY IN2BONES SAS IMMEDIATELY. IN NOVEMBER 2020, A WEBTRADER CERTIFICATE ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND, AT THE SAME TIME, IN2BONES DISCOVERED THE MESSAGES INDICATING THE RECEPTION FAILURES OF SOME EMDRS. IN CONSEQUENCE, THESE EMDRS WERE CORRECTED AND ARE NOW BEING FILED RETROSPECTIVELY."

THE DRILL APPEARED FRACTURED ON ONE END, WHICH FURTHER CONTRIBUTES TO THE SUSPICION THAT THE SURGEON RAN INTO SOMETHING DURING THE DRILLING PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY, X-RAYS SHOW THAT THE FRACTURED TIP WAS RELATIVELY DEEP IN THE BONE. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF WHERE THE K-WIRE WAS, BUT PER THE REP PRESENT IN THE CASE, THERE WAS A WIRE USED FOR GUIDANCE THAT WAS REMOVED PRIOR TO THE X-RAYS.

A CANNULATED FLEXIBLE REAMER (NOT MANUFACTURED, BUT DISTRIBUTED BY IN2BONES SAS) FOR THE TIBIA WAS USED TO MAKE SPACE FOR THE NAIL TO BE INSERTED. AFTER PLACING THE K-WIRE IN SITU, WHILE THE SURGEON WAS REAMING HE REMARKED IT ENCOUNTERED SOME RESISTANCE, BUT CONTINUED TO REAM. UPON REMOVING THE REAMER IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE REAMER HAD ACTUALLY ADVANCED THE K-WIRE UP THE TIBIA AND THROUGH THE INTERCONDYLAR NOTCH INTO THE FEMUR APPROXIMATELY 5 CM. THE SURGEONS WERE UNABLE TO REMOVE THE WIRE FROM ORIGINAL INCISION AT THE ANKLE, TRIED MAKING AN INCISION IN THE KNEE BUT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL AT LOCATING IT. THEY THEN CREATED A SMALL WINDOW IN THE DISTAL TIBIA AND WERE ABLE GRASP THE WIRE AND REMOVE IT. SURGERY PROGRESSED WITHOUT INCIDENT AFTER THIS POINT AND A GOOD SURGICAL OUTCOME WAS OBTAINED."

AS THE TORX IMPRINT DID NOT ENGAGE, I THOUGHT THAT THE SCREWDRIVER IMPRINT WAS DAMAGED, BUT IT WAS THE IMPRINT OF THE SCREW HEAD THAT WAS DAMAGED AND PARTIALLY BROKEN (WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE SCREWING COULD NOT BE FINISHED); IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE THE SCREW, I HAD TO SAW THE SCREW HEAD PART THAT WAS PROTRUDING FROM THE FIRST METATARSAL BONE. CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES OBSERVED: THE PATIENT BEING UNDER LOCO-REGIONAL ANESTHESIA, SHE HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD THE DIFFICULTIES. I POST-OPERATIVELY GAVE HER THE FOLLOWING EXPLANATIONS: NO CONSEQUENCES EXPECTED FOR THE UPCOMING BONY CONSOLIDATION. BUT DIFFICULTY OR IMPOSSIBILITY TO REMOVE THE SCREW IF REQUIRED AT A LATER DATE\". THE SURGERY ENDED SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT ANY CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PATIENT.

AFTER A SERIES OF BREAKAGES REPORTED, THIS SPECIFIC BURR REFERENCE WAS SUBJECT TO A DESIGN CHANGE EARLIER THIS YEAR (B)(4), TO ADJUST THE DRAWINGS MANUFACTURING TOLERANCES TO PREVENT BREAKAGES FROM OCCURING AGAIN. SOME BATCHES WERE IDENTIFIED AS DIMENSIONALLY NON-COMPLIANT AND A BATCH RECALL WAS ORGANISED. THIS BATCH 1910123 WAS MANUFACTURED BEFORE THE DESIGN CHANGE WAS IMPLEMENTED. IT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE BATCH RECALL AS INVESTIGATION HAD CONFIRMED ITS DIMENSIONS WERE WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS THROUGH DIMENSIONAL DESTRUCTIVE INSPECTION.

THE FIRST INTERVENTION HAS BEEN PERFORMED WITH THIS PLATE ON A RELATIVELY SIMPLE FRACTURE. THE OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN FOLLOWED AS INDICATED IN THE BROCHURE. IN THE BEGINNING THE FIRST SCREW HAS BEEN POSITIONED IN THE OBLONG PROXIMAL HOLE OF THE PLATE, THEN ALL THE OTHER DISTAL SCREWS. DURING THE FLUOROSCOPY CHECK THE SURGEON DECIDED TO CHANGE THE MEASURE OF THE SCREW IN THE OBLONG HOLE (14MM), BECAUSE HE ASSESSED IT WAS TOO LONG. SO HE STARTED WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE INSERTED SCREW REF. W27 ST014. AS HE ENGAGED THE SCREW AND TURNED THE DRIVER BACKWARD TO REMOVE IT, THE SCREW-HEAD BROKE UP, LEAVING THE SCREWED STEM INTO THE BONE. NO STRENGTH HAS BEEN REQUIRED FOR THIS TO OCCUR AND THE FIRST SCREW WAS NOT EVEN TIGHTENED TOTALLY AS RECOMMENDED IN THE TECHNIQUE. THE SURGEON TRIED TO REMOVE THE STEM WITH A NON-INVASIVE APPROACH, BUT WITHOUT ANY SUCCESS. SO HE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE STEM INTO THE BONE TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER DAMAGE FOR THE PATIENT.\" PATIENT OUTCOME REPORTED BY OUR DISTRIBUTOR: \"- SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF THE SURGERY TIME : ADDITION OF 20MIN FOR A SURGERY THAT USUALLY TAKES AROUND 1 HOUR. - NO IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE FOR THE PATIENT, BUT SURGEON ESTIMATED THAT IF THE PLATE HAS TO BE REMOVED IN THE FUTURE, IT WILL TAKE A MORE INVASIVE PROCEDURE TO REMOVE THE STEM.\" ADDITIONAL COMMENT FROM IN2BONES: THE BROKEN PART OF THE SCREW DOES NOT HAVE TO BE REMOVED, IF THE PATIENT FEELS NO PAIN, THE NEOVIEW SYSTEM CAN REMAIN IMPLANTED AFTER BONE FUSION."

A SMALL STATURE PERSON). IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE IMPLANTED PIECE HAS A VERY LOW RISK OF CORROSION (PASSIVATED LAYER). AND EVEN IF IT WERE TO BE FULLY CORRODED, THE PIECE IS NOT LIKELY TO INDUCE ANY TOXICOLOGICAL REACTION DUE TO THE LOW QUANTITY OF COMPOUNDS HYPOTHETICALLY RELEASED INTO THE BODY (SAFETY RATIOS BETWEEN 9 AND 95000 DEPENDING UPON THE COMPOUNDS). IN ADDITION, THE RISK OF MIGRATION OF THE PIECE OF SCREWDRIVER IS JUDGED REMOTE, SINCE IT IS STUCK IN THE IMPLANTABLE OSTEOSYNTHESIS SCREW HEAD, WITH TIGHT TOLERANCES. THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCURRENCE OF THIS DEVICE BREAKAGE RECORDED INTO IN2BONES (B)(4). SUCH EVENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED IN THE FUTURE."

UPON VIEWING THE X-RAYS, THE SURGEON FELT THE SCREWS IMPLANTED WERE TOO LONG AND DECIDED TO REMOVE TWO SCREWS AND REPLACE THEM WITH SHORTER SCREWS. THE FIRST SCREW WAS REMOVED USING THE IN2BONES SAS TORX T8 ATTACHMENT SCREWDRIVER WITH NO ISSUE.
